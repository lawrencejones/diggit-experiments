# diggit - experiments

An electron app that provides a framework for diggit related prototyping,
visualisations and experiements. Main repo is located at
[lawrencejones/diggit](https://github.com/lawrencejones/diggit).

## Setup

This app requires a copy of the main diggit repo to access scripts. To this end,
clone the repo and then export the path to the `DIGGIT_PATH` environment
variable.

## Features

### Code Overview

Can we pull data from a repo that enables us to identify how the architectural
shape of the project changed over time?

This represents an experiment in data parsing and presentation. Aims are to gain
familiarity with the git API and gain some experience with data visualisation
toolkits, along with extract genuine insights from the code.

### Refactor Diligence
